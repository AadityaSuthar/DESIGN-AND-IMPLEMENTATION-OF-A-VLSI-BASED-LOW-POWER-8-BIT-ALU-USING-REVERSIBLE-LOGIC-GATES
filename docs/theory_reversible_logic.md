Reversible Logic – Basic Understanding
 What is Reversible Logic?
Reversible logic is a design approach where the number of inputs equals the
number of outputs, and the original inputs can be uniquely recovered from
the outputs. This helps in reducing information loss.

 Why Reversible Logic?
According to Landauer’s principle, loss of information leads to energy
dissipation. Reversible logic aims to minimize this loss, making it suitable
for low-power VLSI designs.

 Relevance to ALU Design
In this project, reversible logic gates are explored as building blocks for
designing an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) to reduce power consumption.
