# DKG Gate

The DKG gate is a 4×4 reversible logic gate specifically designed for efficient
implementation of arithmetic operations, particularly full adders. It is known
for producing both Sum and Carry outputs within a single reversible gate,
thereby reducing gate count and garbage outputs.

## Input–Output Relationship
- Inputs: A, B, Cin, D
- Outputs:
  - P = A
  - Q = B
  - R = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin  (Sum)
  - S = (A · B) + (Cin · (A ⊕ B)) ⊕ D  (Carry)

## Importance in Reversible Design
The DKG gate is optimized for reversible arithmetic circuits as it combines
XOR and carry-generation logic efficiently. By generating Sum and Carry
simultaneously, it simplifies reversible full adder design compared to
multi-gate implementations.

## Role in This Project
In this project, the DKG gate is implemented using transmission-gate-based logic
in Cadence Virtuoso. It is evaluated as an alternative reversible building
block for full adder realization and compared with Peres-gate-based designs in
terms of complexity and suitability for ALU construction.
