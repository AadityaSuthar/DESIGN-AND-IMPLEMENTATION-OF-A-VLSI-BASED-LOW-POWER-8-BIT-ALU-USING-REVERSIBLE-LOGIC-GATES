# Fredkin Gate

The Fredkin gate is a 3×3 reversible logic gate also known as the
Controlled-SWAP (CSWAP) gate. It conditionally swaps its two data inputs based
on the value of a control input, while preserving reversibility.

## Input–Output Relationship
- Inputs: A (control), B, C
- Outputs:
  - P = A
  - Q = A'·B + A·C
  - R = A·B + A'·C

## Importance in Reversible Design
The Fredkin gate performs data routing and conditional selection without
information loss, which makes it useful in reversible control logic and
multiplexing operations.

## Role in This Project
In this project, the Fredkin gate is implemented using transmission-gate-based
logic in Cadence Virtuoso. Although it is not the primary gate used for
arithmetic operations, it is included to demonstrate reversible control and
data-flow manipulation within the ALU architecture.
