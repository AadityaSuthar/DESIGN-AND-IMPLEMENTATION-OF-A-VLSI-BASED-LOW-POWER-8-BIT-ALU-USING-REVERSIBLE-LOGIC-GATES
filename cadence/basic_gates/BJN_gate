# BJN Gate

The BJN gate is a 4×4 reversible logic gate proposed for efficient realization
of arithmetic circuits, particularly reversible full adders. It is designed to
generate Sum and Carry outputs with reduced garbage outputs and optimized gate
count.

## Input–Output Relationship
- Inputs: A, B, Cin, D
- Outputs:
  - P = A
  - Q = B
  - R = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin  (Sum)
  - S = (A · B) + (B · Cin) + (A · Cin) ⊕ D  (Carry)

## Importance in Reversible Design
The BJN gate efficiently combines XOR and majority-based carry generation
within a single reversible structure. This makes it suitable for low-power
arithmetic applications where minimizing complexity and information loss is
critical.

## Role in This Project
In this project, the BJN gate is implemented at the transistor level using
transmission-gate-based logic in Cadence Virtuoso. It is studied as an
alternative reversible full adder implementation and compared with Peres- and
DKG-gate-based designs to evaluate suitability for the 8-bit ALU.
