# Toffoli Gate

The Toffoli gate is a 3×3 reversible logic gate also known as the Controlled-
Controlled-NOT (CCNOT) gate. It preserves the first two inputs and conditionally
toggles the third output when both control inputs are high.

The Toffoli gate is functionally universal for reversible computation and is
particularly useful for implementing AND and carry-generation logic. In this
project, it serves as a key building block for the reversible full adder design.
