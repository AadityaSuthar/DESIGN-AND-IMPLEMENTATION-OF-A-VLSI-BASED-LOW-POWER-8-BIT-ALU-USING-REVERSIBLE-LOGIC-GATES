# Transmission Gate

The transmission gate is implemented using a parallel combination of one NMOS
and one PMOS transistor controlled by complementary signals. When the control
signal is active, the gate allows bidirectional signal flow with reduced
voltage degradation compared to a single pass transistor.

In this project, the transmission gate is used as a fundamental building block
for implementing reversible logic gates at the transistor level in Cadence
Virtuoso.
