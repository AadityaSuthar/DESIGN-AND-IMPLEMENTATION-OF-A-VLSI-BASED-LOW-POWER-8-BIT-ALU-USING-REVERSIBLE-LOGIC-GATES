# Feynman Gate

The Feynman gate is a 2×2 reversible logic gate commonly used for signal copying
and inversion, since fan-out is not permitted in reversible logic circuits.
It produces outputs P = A and Q = A ⊕ B.

In this project, the Feynman gate is implemented using transmission-gate-based
logic in Cadence Virtuoso and is used as a fundamental building block in the
construction of higher-level reversible circuits.
There is a Garbage output too. As we can also use use AxnorB anywhere else too.
