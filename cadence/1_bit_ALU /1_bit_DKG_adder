# 1-bit Reversible Full Adder using DKG Gate

## Description
This design implements a 1-bit reversible full adder using the DKG reversible
logic gate. The DKG gate is capable of generating both Sum and Carry outputs
within a single reversible structure.

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: A, B, Cin
- Outputs: Sum, Cout

## Design Details
The DKG gate combines XOR and carry-generation logic efficiently, reducing the
number of reversible gates and garbage outputs compared to multi-gate adder
implementations.

## Role in This Project
This DKG-based full adder is implemented and analyzed as an alternative
reversible adder architecture. Its structure and efficiency are compared with
the Peres-gate-based full adder used in the final 8-bit ALU design.
