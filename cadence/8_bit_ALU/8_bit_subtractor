# 8-bit Reversible Adder and Subtractor

## Description
This module implements an 8-bit reversible adder and subtractor by cascading
eight identical 1-bit reversible arithmetic blocks. The design supports both
addition and subtraction operations while preserving reversibility and
minimizing information loss.

## Architecture
The 8-bit structure is formed by connecting the carry (or borrow) output of
each 1-bit stage to the next higher bit stage. A common control signal is used
to select between addition and subtraction modes.

## Operation
- **Addition Mode**:
  - The circuit performs A + B using reversible full adders.
  - Carry propagates from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most
    significant bit (MSB).

- **Subtraction Mode**:
  - The circuit performs A − B using reversible subtraction logic.
  - Borrow propagation follows a similar cascading structure as carry.

## Design Details
Each 1-bit arithmetic block is implemented using reversible logic gates
(DKG / Peres-based structures), ensuring that all operations maintain a
one-to-one input–output mapping. The modular design allows easy scaling and
simplifies verification.

## Importance in Reversible ALU Design
The 8-bit adder and subtractor form the core arithmetic unit of the reversible
ALU. Implementing these operations using reversible logic demonstrates the
feasibility of low-power arithmetic circuits suitable for future computing
paradigms.

## Role in This Project
In this project, the 8-bit reversible adder and subtractor serve as the primary
arithmetic engine of the ALU. The design is implemented and validated using
Cadence Virtuoso and forms the foundation for higher-level ALU operations.
