# 1-bit Reversible Subtractor using DKG Gate

## Description
This design implements a 1-bit reversible subtractor using the DKG reversible
logic gate. The subtractor computes the difference between two input bits while
preserving reversibility and minimizing information loss.

## Inputs and Outputs
- Inputs: A (minuend), B (subtrahend), Bin (borrow-in)
- Outputs: Diff, Bout (borrow-out)

## Design Details
The DKG gate efficiently supports arithmetic operations by combining XOR-based
difference generation and borrow logic within a single reversible structure.
The Difference output is obtained using XOR operations, while the Borrow output
is generated through conditional lo
