# 8-bit ALU Architecture Overview

## High-Level Description
The 8-bit ALU is composed of eight identical 1-bit ALU slices connected in
a cascaded manner. Each slice performs arithmetic and logic operations using
reversible logic gates.

## Main Blocks
- Reversible 1-bit ALU slice
- Control logic for operation selection
- Carry propagation between slices

## Design Note
At this stage, the architecture is defined conceptually. Detailed schematics
and layouts will be developed using Cadence tools in later stages.
